        <p>Understandably, the go-to is often 'degrees of warming,' <b>but 99â€¯% of people don't really know what that means.</b>Â We need to be clear that we're not just talking about hotter weather or more rain.Â Maintaining business as usual has the potential to lead toÂ <b>Wars, Global Financial Collapse, Famine, Diseases, Hyper Violence, and Mass Death.</b></p><p>Remember, it's not just emissions. We're <b><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh2458" target="_blank">overshooting 6 out of 9 planetary boundaries</a>Â </b>that are crucial for the regeneration of life.</p><p><b>Trying to avoid scaring people by not talking about these things has been a huge mistake.</b><br></p>
