        <p>Understandably, the go-to is often 'degrees of warming,' <b>but 99% of people don't really know what that means.</b>Â We need to be clear that we're not just talking about hotter weather or more rain.Â Maintaining business as usual has the potential to lead toÂ <b>Wars, Global Financial Collapse, Famine, Diseases, Hyper Violence, and Mass Death.</b></p><p>Remember, it's not just emissions.
