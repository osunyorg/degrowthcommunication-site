    <p>  <br>Despite  2023 being the hottest year ever documented, Â  despite  records being broken for greenhouse gas levels, ocean heat and acidification, sea level rise, Antarctic sea cover, and glacier retreat, Â despite the  wealthiest among us being overwhelmingly responsible ,  corporate broadcast news  decreased climate coverage by 25% , bringing it to a grand total of  less than 1% of total broadcast content . It's clear that corporate media won't save the day... So we need to improve our strategies.Â </p>  <p>   <br>But we can't allow ourselves to fall into despair. We have a responsibility to act! Degrowth offers actionable narratives filled with hope and strength.</p>  <p>   <br>Stand up, speak out, and let's create a future where everyone thrives.  Your action today is the hope for our tomorrow.</p>  <p>   <br>So take advantage of this website!Â  Explore, Discover, Learn, Communicate, Discuss, Create, Translate,Â  Empathise Â and most importantly, have FUN doing it!Â </p>  <p>   <br>Whoever controls the narrative controls the world</p>  <p>  All the work on this site is free to be used in any way, shape or form; republish it, modify it, translate it, use it on merchandise; whatever you want.
