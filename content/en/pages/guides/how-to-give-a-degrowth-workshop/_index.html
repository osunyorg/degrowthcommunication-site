    How to Give a Degrowth Workshop
  summary: >-
    <p>This crafted workshop outline is designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools needed to introduce the basic concepts and ideas of degrowth to an audience. It includes information about organising, preparing and running the workshop.   It aims to foster a space for learning, reflection, and discussion, possibly even leading to action.</p>

    <p>  <br>A comprehensive guide is available, offering in-depth insights into degrowth across all the recommended topics. The details enhance your understanding and exploration of degrowth, providing a richer context and broader perspective</p>  <p>Access the Detailed Guide Here! <br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/11TuVwZrKpvoOk4gnIVXkBd7X-PaGr3hvRGOJC1pswiI/edit?usp=sharing</p>  <p>   <br>This guide was initially written by Anisa and  Degrowth Network Australia (DNA)  organisation. It has been expanded and reworded to increase its accessibility and usability.</p>  <p> Planning the Workshop  <br>   <br>Form a team:  Working with one or two other people can make the planning process easier, allowing you to divide tasks such as facilitation, content, logistics, and snacks. If you prefer to organise solo, consider enlisting volunteers for specific roles during the workshop to ensure it runs smoothly. Logistics :  Identify a suitable location, date, and time (2 hours is best!) for your workshop well in advance. Ensure the venue is accessible to all participants. Advertise !  Word of mouth, email lists, social media, posters, and announcements at related gatherings can go a long way.  Here is a workshop description you can use or modify: Confront the challenges of rising global emissions, biodiversity loss, and increasing societal disconnection with us. The degrowth movement offers a hopeful vision for the future, critiquing the relentless pursuit of economic growth and proposing a society focused on ecological balance, justice and collective well-being. Join our interactive workshop to explore what degrowth entails, its potential benefits for you and your community, and how we can collectively strive towards the transformative change our world needs. Utilise available resources:  Use our ready-made presentation slides (or your own!) if your workshop location includes a projector or screen. They are designed to be flexible, and we strongly encourage you to modify them to suit your local context better. Doing so can make the presentation much more relatable, actionable and engaging. Access the presentations by clicking the image below.</p>  <p> Setting Up the Workshop on the Day  <br>   <br>Ensuring a smooth and welcoming start to your degrowth workshop is crucial for fostering a safer and more comfortable learning environment (remember, degrowth is scary at first!).  Arrive early:  Aim to arrive at the venue at least 30 minutes early so you can set up the space, troubleshoot any last-minute issues and coordinate with facilitators/volunteers.  Accessibility and guidance:  Ensure the workshop location is accessible to all attendees. Consider placing signs or assigning volunteers to help direct attendees. Arrange seating:  Place chairs in a circle or semi-circle, depending on your workshop type. Circles foster a sense of community and make it easier for everyone to engage, whilst semi-circles are better for more direct presentations. You can also do both! Greet participants!  Crucial to create a friendly and inviting atmosphere from the moment they arrive. A personal greeting can help participants feel valued, heard and comfortable. Prepare a Sign-Up Sheet:  Have an optional sign-up sheet ready at the entrance or passed around during the workshop. Collecting contact information allows for follow-up discussions, sharing additional resources, and building community.  Please be safe and responsible with this data!</p>  <p> Draft Workshop Outline  <br>   <br>Acknowledgement of territory and land (5 minutes) If applicable, begin the workshop by recognising the traditional custodians of the land where you are meeting. Highlight that degrowth aims to learn about the sustainable practices long upheld by Indigenous peoples and other communities worldwide and that we strive to support—in deed, not merely in word— their liberation. Tailor this acknowledgement to reflect the local context and your personal connection to the movement. Introductions (10-15 minutes) Facilitate a round of introductions where participants share their names, pronouns (optional), and why they are here (this is where the circle arrangement works great). Starting with yourself to break the ice. For larger groups, you can split into smaller groups of about five to maintain intimacy and ensure everyone has a chance to speak.  Potential degrowth topics to discuss: 1. Introduction to degrowth (5 minutes)  <br> Briefly introduce the concept of degrowth and its relevance in today's world.  <br> Discuss the historical context and the emergence of the degrowth movement.  <br> 2. The critique of growth (10 minutes)  <br> Examine the limitations of continuous economic growth, including environmental degradation, social inequality, eroding democracy and the depletion of natural resources.  <br> Discuss how current economic systems prioritise GDP growth over well-being and ecological health.  <br> 3. Principles of degrowth (10 minutes) Dive into the core principles of degrowth: sustainability, democracy, justice, and well-being. Explore how these principles interconnect to form the foundation of degrowth philosophy.  <br> 4. Degrowth policies (10 minutes) Discuss key policies for a degrowth approach: aiming for well-being without economic growth and reducing resource use. 5. Degrowth in practice (5-10 minutes)  <br> Present real-world examples and case studies (ideally local ones!) where degrowth principles have been applied, from local communities to national policies.  <br> Discuss practical steps individuals and communities can take to embody degrowth in daily life.  <br> 6. Challenges and criticisms (5 minutes)  <br> Address common criticisms and challenges facing the degrowth movement.  <br>  <br> Facilitate a discussion on overcoming these hurdles and the feasibility of degrowth as a global strategy.  <br> 7. Envisioning a degrowth future (10 minutes)  <br> Engage participants in imagining a degrowth future: What does it look like? How does it function?  <br> Use creative exercises or guided discussions to envision societal transformation under degrowth.  <br> 8. Action and mobilisation (15 minutes)  <br> Discuss strategies for advocating degrowth and mobilising for change at various levels, from local initiatives to global movements.   <br> Encourage participants to identify personal actions they can take and explore ways to get involved in degrowth activism.  <br> 9. Conclusion and reflection (10-45 minutes)  <br> Summarise key takeaways from the workshop.  <br>  <br> Provide ample space for participants to reflect on what they've learned, share insights, ask questions and discuss how they can contribute to the movement.  <br> Feedback: (5 minutes) If you have time, ask the group for feedback. Emphasise the value of their input to make future workshops better, so be sure to encourage criticism! If you're short on time, distribute small pieces of paper and pens for written responses.  </p>  <p>   <br>Timo and Alex from  Degrowth in Action  have created a phenomenal degrowth workshop workbook! They cover many essential topics and provide various activities and resources. </p>  <p>Access and download the workbook here! <br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RzpzfSUbisStAbf2OyfGIo5wgCfEuq-E/view?usp=sharing</p>  <p> Debrief  <br>   <br>Once the workshop ends and the participants have left, take a moment with your fellow organisers or facilitators to talk about how the workshop went, celebrate successes and think about what your could do better next time:)</p>  <p> Tips and Advice  <br>   <br>Foster empathy:  Remember, the concept of degrowth challenges many deeply ingrained beliefs and values. Approach the topic with empathy, recognising that participants are at different stages of understanding and acceptance. Create a safer space for everyone to express their thoughts and concerns without judgment. Discuss, not lecture:  The workshop should feel as much like a participative discussion rather than a lecture. Use open-ended questions, invite participants to share their perspectives, and incorporate interactive activities when applicable. Degrowth is academic enough as is! Use relatable examples:  Connect abstract concepts to real-world scenarios as much as possible. Sharing stories or case studies that illustrate degrowth in action makes it much more relatable and achievable. Practice active listening:  Show that you value participants' contributions by listening actively. Acknowledge their input, build on their ideas, and address their questions thoughtfully. This not only enhances learning but also builds rapport and trust. Respect!  It's essential to respect the diverse viewpoints and backgrounds of your participants. Avoid assuming a superior stance or dismissing questions and concerns. Remember, the goal is to enlighten and engage, not to belittle.  Be prepared and organised:  While fostering a discussion-based environment, it's also important to guide the conversation to ensure all key points are covered. Have a clear structure for the workshop but remain flexible to explore topics that particularly interest your audience. End with actionable steps:  Conclude the workshop by encouraging participants to think about how they can further the aims of the degrowth movement. Discuss actionable steps and provide resources for further exploration.</p>  <p> Extra Resources  <br>   <br>Check out this incredibly designed and illustrated educational process representing a conversation starter on Degrowth.

        <p><b>Foster empathy:</b> Remember, the concept of degrowth challenges many deeply ingrained beliefs and values. Approach the topic with empathy, recognising that participants are at different stages of understanding and acceptance. Create a safer space for everyone to express their thoughts and concerns without judgment.</p><p><b>Discuss, not lecture: </b>The workshop should feel as much like a participative discussion rather than a lecture. Use open-ended questions, invite participants to share their perspectives, and incorporate interactive activities when applicable. Degrowth is academic enough as is!</p><p><b>Use relatable examples:</b> Connect abstract concepts to real-world scenarios as much as possible. Sharing stories or case studies that illustrate degrowth in action makes it much more relatable and achievable.</p><p><b>Practice active listening: </b>Show that you value participants' contributions by listening actively. Acknowledge their input, build on their ideas, and address their questions thoughtfully. This not only enhances learning but also builds rapport and trust.</p><p><b>Respect!</b> It's essential to respect the diverse viewpoints and backgrounds of your participants. Avoid assuming a superior stance or dismissing questions and concerns. Remember, the goal is to enlighten and engage, not to belittle. </p><p><b>Be prepared and organised:</b> While fostering a discussion-based environment, it's also important to guide the conversation to ensure all key points are covered. Have a clear structure for the workshop but remain flexible to explore topics that particularly interest your audience.</p><p><b>End with actionable steps:</b> Conclude the workshop by encouraging participants to think about how they can further the aims of the degrowth movement. Discuss actionable steps and provide resources for further exploration.</p>
