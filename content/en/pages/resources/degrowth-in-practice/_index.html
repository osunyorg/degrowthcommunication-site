    Degrowth in Practice
  summary: >-
    <p>Ever wondered what degrowth might look like in practice? There are dozens of examples of the many ways it can take shape in our everyday lives. Take a look at the initiatives below and maybe think about what you could do in your community. </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Degrowth is not an abstract theory—it flourishes through thousands of concrete initiatives that shrink material throughput while expanding solidarity, equality, autonomy and ecological care.  Degrowth in practice  often begins with modest, place-based experiments, community gardens, repair cafés, cooperative housing, time banks, that prove lives of sufficiency, care and conviviality are already within reach. Yet we cannot mistake these projects for the transformation itself.  Genuine degrowth also demands decoupling wellbeing from exploitative global supply chains, dismantling the economic and political structures that funnel wealth and power to the richest nations and classes, and securing equitable access to food, shelter, energy and democratic voice for everyone.  In short, a tool-library alone will not remake the world, but it can prefigure and strengthen the broader movements for debt justice, climate reparations, delinking, and economic decolonisation that must accompany it.  The examples below should therefore be read as sparks of possibility-helpful for their communities, inspiring for others to replicate and adapt-while always reminding us that deep systemic change remains the collective horizon we cannot afford to forget. *We recognize the list below is highly Eurocentric. If you have other examples to add please do reach out to explore[at]degrowth.net :)</p>  <p> Community‑Supported Agriculture (CSA) & Community Gardens 🌽  <br>   <br>CSAs are community-run projects for food production, reducing energy use by eliminating logistics chains. The model relies on collective investment, fostering collective decision-making and commitment.  Community gardens offer transformative experiences, reconnecting people with nature and fostering cooperation. Groups can organize collective or individual plots, with local authorities often providing land for cultivation.</p>  <p>   <br>Pluk! Groenten van West  (Amsterdam) is a CSA founded in 2017 where members, known as "harvesters," purchase a share of the season's produce in advance.</p>  <p>Check them out here!  <br>https://plukcsa.nl/</p>  <p> Repair Workshops 🛠️  <br>   <br>To combat planned obsolescence, repair workshops help extend the life of items, reducing unnecessary consumption. They teach repair skills and help build community.</p>  <p>   <br>Repair Café is a global grassroots initiative that encourages people to repair broken items instead of throwing them away. Volunteers help participants fix items while teaching repair skills. </p>  <p>Check it out here! <br>https://www.repaircafe.org/</p>  <p> Time Volunteering ⌛  <br>   <br>Time volunteering, such as time banks, allows people to exchange services based on time, not money. It fosters solidarity and community relationships, with over 100 time banks already active in Spain. Services like cooking or repairs are traded using hours as currency.</p>  <p>   <br>TimeBanks operates on the principle that one hour of help equals one time credit, promoting equality and mutual support. Other examples are, for instance, WWOOF, Workaway, and HelpX.</p>  <p>Check it out here! <br>http://TimeBanks.org</p>  <p> Alternative Currencies 💴  <br>   <br>Currencies that promote local economies by facilitating trade without relying on traditional money. These currencies encourage local spending and reduce dependency on mainstream financial systems.</p>  <p>Several bills of various different currencies on a table <br>Photo by  Phillip Flores  on  Unsplash  <br>       <br>   <br>​ Grama is a digital local currency launched in Spain, in 2017 to bolster the local economy and keep public funds circulating within the city. Fully backed by euros, the city council issues gramas through public spending and employee salaries. </p>  <p>Check it out here! <br>https://www.shareable.net/how-one-city-in-spain-launched-a-local-currency/</p>  <p> Sharing Platforms 🤲  <br>   <br>Community-based systems where people can access shared items-such as tools, kitchen appliances, sports gear, food or camping equipment-instead of buying to access them. Members can borrow, reserve, or sometimes rent items for short-term use.</p>  <p>   <br>The Library of Things enables individuals to borrow household items via self-service lockers in community spaces.  FoodCycle  combines surplus food with volunteer efforts to provide meals for those in need, while  One Million Voices  facilitates the sharing of knowledge on agroecology.</p>  <p>Check it out here! <br>https://www.libraryofthings.co.uk/</p>  <p> Bartering Communities 🥾  <br>   <br>People exchange goods or services directly without using money. For example, someone might trade homemade bread for gardening help, an old pair of shoes, or clothing repairs. </p>  <p>   <br>Bunz is a bartering app that began in Toronto, allowing users to trade items like clothing or furniture without money.  Jédonne , based in France, enables people to give away unwanted items for free.</p>  <p>Check it out here! <br>https://bunz.com/</p>  <p> Energy Communities ⚡  <br>   <br>Energy communities are groups of residents, small businesses and public bodies that join forces to generate, own and manage renewable energy locally, sharing the electricity or income among members and keeping the benefits within the community. By pooling resources they can install solar arrays, wind turbines or micro-hydro systems, lower utility bills, and give participants a direct voice in energy decisions, which helps democratise the sector and cut emissions. </p>  <p> Cooperative Housing 🏡  <br>   <br>Cooperative housing is a form of living affordably where inhabitants collectively own their own dwellings and share many essential facilities: meals, tools, vehicles, or anything that makes no sense to own individually, such as a lawnmower. </p>  <p>   <br>VrijLoop  is a Dutch network of cooperative housing initiatives that removes real estate from the market by collectively owning properties and preventing them from being sold for profit.</p>  <p>Check it out here! <br>https://vrijcoop.org/</p>  <p> Cooperative Supermarkets 🛒  <br>   <br>These are food stores owned by employees, customers, or producers who form a cooperative to manage the store. They focus on local, sustainable products and fair labour practices. Members decide on supply chains, prioritising ecological and socially responsible products.</p>  <p> Transition Movement 🌄  <br>   <br>The Transition Movement is framed within the context of how to adapt to energy descent. It aims to rely entirely on renewable sources, owned by local communities, allowing for more resilience and nurturing a culture of creativity and conviviality.  In essence, it seeks a profound transformation in how communities organise and live. As of 2024, the Transition Network website lists 27 hubs and over 1,000 groups worldwide, such as  Squat!net ,  ClimateSafe Village ,  Global Ecovillage Network ,  Diggers & Dreamers ,  Transition Towns .  For this transition to take place, convivial technology must be developed. ​ Wind Empowerment  is an example of a business that manufactures small wind turbines for sustainable rural electrification.  L’Atelier Paysan  or  Farm Hack  are other good examples, cooperatives that empower small-scale farmers to design and build their own agricultural tools and structures. </p>  <p> Zones to Defend 🛡️  <br>   <br>ZTDs occur when activists physically occupy a space to block the development of polluting projects. The most famous  ZTD took place in France , where activists set up a camp for over a decade to block the construction of an airport. The blockade succeeded, and certain activists are planning to stay permanently and are in the process of obtaining permits. </p>  <p> Commoning 🌻  <br>   <br>Commoning is the act of creating and maintaining relationships between people and communities around the use of a particular key resource or space. Commoning aims to maintain the availability of a resource for the use of all members of society. It is the opposite of privatisation of resources for profit.  Creative Commons  is a good example of this, providing copyright licenses to allow free sharing, retaining certain rights. </p>  <p> Further Reading 📖  <br>   <br>  <br> Our comrades at Ontgroei explain what real-life examples of degrowth look like .   <br> IDN volunteer Jose Gil Cuesta wrote his master's thesis on “ The climate urgency of degrowth and its practice in the transition movement ” (in Spanish).  <br>  <br> A list of hundreds of degrowth policies explained.  Made by IDN Volunteer Sara al Mahdi.  </p>

        <p>Energy communities are groups of residents, small businesses and public bodies that join forces to generate, own and manage renewable energy locally, sharing the electricity or income among members and keeping the benefits within the community. By pooling resources they can install solar arrays, wind turbines or micro-hydro systems, lower utility bills, and give participants a direct voice in energy decisions, which helps democratise the sector and cut emissions. </p>

        <p>The Transition Movement is framed within the context of how to adapt to energy descent. It aims to rely entirely on renewable sources, owned by local communities, allowing for more resilience and nurturing a culture of creativity and conviviality. </p><p>In essence, it seeks a profound transformation in how communities organise and live. As of 2024, the Transition Network website lists 27 hubs and over 1,000 groups worldwide, such as <a href="https://en.squat.net/">Squat!net</a>, <a href="https://www.climatesafevillages.org/">ClimateSafe Village</a>, <a href="https://ecovillage.org/regions/">Global Ecovillage Network</a>, <a href="https://diggersanddreamers.org.uk/">Diggers & Dreamers</a>, <a href="https://transitionnetwork.org/">Transition Towns</a>. <br><br>For this transition to take place, convivial technology must be developed. ​<a href="https://windempowerment.org/">Wind Empowerment</a> is an example of a business that manufactures small wind turbines for sustainable rural electrification. <a href="https://www.latelierpaysan.org/">L’Atelier Paysan</a> or <a href="https://farmhack.org/wiki/getting-started">Farm Hack</a> are other good examples, cooperatives that empower small-scale farmers to design and build their own agricultural tools and structures. </p>

        <p>ZTDs occur when activists physically occupy a space to block the development of polluting projects. The most famous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/dec/28/end-of-la-zad-frances-utopian-anti-airport-community-faces-bitter-last-stand">ZTD took place in France</a>, where activists set up a camp for over a decade to block the construction of an airport. The blockade succeeded, and certain activists are planning to stay permanently and are in the process of obtaining permits. </p>

        <p>Commoning is the act of creating and maintaining relationships between people and communities around the use of a particular key resource or space. Commoning aims to maintain the availability of a resource for the use of all members of society. It is the opposite of privatisation of resources for profit. <a href="https://creativecommons.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Creative Commons <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> is a good example of this, providing copyright licenses to allow free sharing, retaining certain rights. </p>
