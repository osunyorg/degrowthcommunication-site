  In creating this website, we have used Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance content and visuals due to limited time and resources. While AI has helped us achieve our goals, we acknowledge its significant environmental and ethical drawbacks. This page aims to transparently disclose our use of AI, address its impacts, and reaffirm our commitment to responsible and mindful technology use in advancing the degrowth movement.

        <p>Hello and thank you for visiting our site. We've dedicated this project towards making the concept of degrowth easy to understand and talk about. In creating this website, we've used Artificial Intelligence (AI) in several ways, and we need to be open about this. We recognize that using AI comes with serious drawbacks, and we want to acknowledge those honestly.</p><p><b>How We Used AI</b></p><p>AI has played a role in the following areas:</p><ul>  <li>  <i>Image Creation</i>: Many of the images on our site were created using AI. This helped us make the site visually appealing (which is, unfortunately, a big deal nowadays) and provide content for visual learners.</li>  <li>  <i>Brainstorming and Feedback</i>: We've used AI to brainstorm ideas, get feedback on structure, and improve the flow of our content.</li>  <li>  <i>Content Generation</i>: Parts of our content were refined or simplified with the help of AI to make sure the content was as accessible, clear and understandable as possible.</li>  </ul><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Why We Used AI</b></p><p>We turned to AI primarily due to limited time and resources. Creating this website was a labour of love, mostly done by a single person who had to balance many tasks. We didn't have the budget to fairly compensate a graphic designer for all the visuals needed, nor the time to handle all of the content manually. AI offered a way to fill these gaps, allowing us to create the content and visuals necessary to make this site informative and engaging. While this was not an ideal solution, it was a practical one given our constraints.</p><p><b>Acknowledging the Impacts of AI</b></p><p>While AI has helped us enhance the site, we must be upfront about the significant downsides and ethical issues involved when using AI:</p><ul>  <li>  <i>Resource Consumption</i>: AI uses a lot of resources. The training and running of AI large language models consume large amounts of energy and water, which contributes to environmental harm, and social injustice. This is a tough pill to swallow for us, given our commitment to sustainability, justice and mindful resource use.</li>  <li>  <i>Ethical Concerns</i>: The development of AI often involves extremely unjust labour practices. Many workers in low-wage countries handle content moderation under poor conditions. Additionally, AI training data often includes art and writings without proper credit or payment to the original creators, essentially stealing their work.</li>  <li>  <i>Impact on Creativity</i>: Relying on AI for content and art generation can undermine the unique and invaluable contributions of human artists and writers. We worry about how this could affect human creativity and the value of genuine human expression.</li>  </ul><p><b>Moving Forward with Caution</b></p><p>As supporters of an ecosocial transformation, we need to be careful about the tools we use. The same technologies that help  us can also conflict with our principles if we're not careful. So we have some advice for those who are thinking of using AI to advance their cause. We recommend using AI tools sparingly and only when they truly help us in ways that align with our values or have major benefits towards the advancement of your cause, campaign or struggle. We also strongly encourage us to be open about our use of AI and its impacts, sharing regular updates and disclosures like the one here. Lastly, there exist various open-source AI models that are more energy-efficient and better aligned with our ethical standards.</p><p>It’s important to remember that those who oppose our vision have no qualms about using AI to further their agendas. We believe that, with caution, transparency and mindfulness, we can leverage these technologies to support our cause without compromising our values. Together, we can work towards a future that is just and regenerative.</p><p>Thank you for your understanding, support, and dedication to these shared goals.</p>
