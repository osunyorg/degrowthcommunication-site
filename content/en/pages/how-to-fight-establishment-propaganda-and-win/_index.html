        <p>Raising public scepticism towards mainstream media is crucial for shifting power to the people from the oligarchs. Influential media personalities have significant power in shaping public opinion and policy, sometimes <a href="http://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20090209/question-morning-joe-or-sen-joe" target="_blank">more than elected officials</a>. By continuously exposing and questioning the media's intentions and actions, we can foster a healthy suspicion among the public. This awareness is vital as it undermines the trust in narratives these media outlets push, effectively challenging their influence.<br></p>

      2. Shatter the Illusion of Normalcy

        <p>Breaking the "normalcy" spell cast by government and media psychological operations is key. The U. S. <a href="https://www.occupycorporatism.com/how-the-ndaa-allows-us-gov-to-use-propaganda-against-americans/" target="_blank">legally</a> uses these operations to <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/03/25/how-us-flooded-the-world-with-psyops/" target="_blank">shape public views</a>, normalizing actions and conditions that should raise concern, such as economic disparity, military aggression, and surveillance. This effort, supported by a media owned by few corporations with historical ties to intelligence agencies, aims to make such issues seem ordinary. The mission is to wake the public up to this manipulation, challenging the acceptance of these so-called norms and encouraging a call for change by questioning the status quo.<br></p>

        <p>Breaking the illusion of consensus is vital. Often, the media, owned by a few, projects a unified stance on major issues, creating a false sense of agreement among the public. This strategy makes unverified claims seem like undeniable facts, marginalizing dissenting voices. The key to combat this is by confidently challenging these narratives and spreading alternative viewpoints as widely as possible<br></p>

      4. Stay Loudly Politically Active

        <p>Keep being vocal in politics despite doubts about real democracy. The establishment prefers silence from those challenging the status quo, hoping they'll fade without influence. Yet, voices from all political spectrums—whether pushing for progressive changes within the system or advocating for alternatives outside it—should amplify their efforts and highlight when they're undermined. Highlighting these instances exposes the lack of genuine democracy and can awaken others to this reality.<br></p>

        <p>Remember and resist the media's short memory cycle. The constant, fast-paced news often makes us forget past misdeeds, like election manipulations, propaganda efforts, and untruths about wars. It's crucial to continuously recall and discuss these issues, preventing them from being swept away by the next news wave. By refusing to forget or forgive these actions, we challenge the establishment's desire for us to move on without addressing past wrongs and demand accountability.<br></p>

      6. Always be Attacking

        <p>Adopt an offensive strategy in challenging media narratives; always be on the attack. Instead of reacting defensively to falsehoods, proactively highlight and critique past and ongoing manipulations, such as election interference or misleading reporting. Focusing on these issues puts the establishment on the defensive and exposes the flaws in their narratives. By continuously exposing their contradictions and questioning their motives, you force them to defend untenable positions, undermining their credibility. <br></p>

        <p>Connecting with like-minded individuals who challenge mainstream narratives is crucial. Interacting with those who recognize the same truths is comforting and reinforcing, especially when the majority seems to follow misleading narratives. Beyond finding those who share similar views, it's important to collaborate across ideological lines to combat the propaganda machine effectively. The effort to dismantle media manipulation can't succeed if limited to one group; it requires a united front across various anti-establishment ideologies. By working together, resisting efforts to be divided, and leveraging diverse perspectives for creative strategies, the movement can grow stronger and more influential. <br></p>

        <p>Embrace the fun in this revolutionary battle. Think of it as being wizards, creatively battling against the deceitful spells cast by those in power. This fight allows us to use our creativity and passion in ways we enjoy, like making memes, writing, and making videos, all while contributing to a significant cause. Facing the darkness head-on can be draining, so it's crucial to maintain a positive approach to avoid burnout. </p><p>There are over <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm" target="_blank">3.7 billion people online</a> and counting. Nothing even remotely like this has ever happened before in human history. You don’t get to be pessimistic in a situation like this. Anything could happen. We can definitely do this. Have fun.</p>
