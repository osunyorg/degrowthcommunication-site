summary: >-
  Below is a list of research, surveys, and poll results showing people's thoughts about degrowth, post-growth and post-capitalist ideas. This collection helps debunk the myth that seeking an economy more in harmony with our environment is hugely unpopular and, therefore, unrealistic. In fact, the data suggests that a significant number of people are open to, and even support, the idea of prioritising ecological well-being over profits and relentless economic growth. <br><br>Explore or reference the insights below to strengthen your arguments or show others the potential support for degrowth.

        <p>It's important to note that these last six studies are remarkable because respondents are <b>willing to prioritize the environment over economic growth, even though they may assume that harming growth could have social downsides</b>.<br></p><p><br>We could expect that if respondents knew that post-growth policies can <i>improve</i> social well-being, support for these statements may be even stronger.</p>
