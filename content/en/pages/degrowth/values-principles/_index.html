    Values & Principles
  summary: >-
    <p>Welcome to the heart of our movement: the values and principles of degrowth. This space explores the core ideas that drive us towards a sustainable and equitable future, from wellbeing and community to justice and care. As with any pluriversal movement, there are a wide variety of values and principles, not all of which must be fulfilled at once for something to qualify as "degrowth". </p>
  body: >-
    <p>Values of Degrowth  <br>   <br>Values in the context of degrowth are the deep-seated beliefs and ideals that motivate the movement's vision for society. They represent the ethical foundation upon which the degrowth philosophy is built.  Autonomy & Democracy Autonomy and democracy are about freeing ourselves from the necessity of working to survive and having the space to make choices that truly enrich our lives. It's about coming together to make decisions democratically, ensuring that our communities live and work in ways that feel right to us.  Care Care is about showing compassion and support for each other, our communities, and all life on Earth. It's about valuing kindness and solidarity over competition and greed. It calls for nurturing relationships and mutual aid, fostering an environment where the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants is prioritised. Justice Justice means ensuring everyone has a fair chance at a good life, no matter where they come from or what they look like. It's about acknowledging and correcting historical wrongs, reducing excess consumption in wealthier nations and among those living beyond their fair share, aiming for social justice and equality both today and for future generations. It's about making sure that downscaling happens where it's needed most to achieve a balanced and fair distribution of the benefits and impacts of our economy. Sustainability & Sufficiency Sustainability and sufficiency ensure everyone has what they need to live well within the ecological limits that allow the planet to support and regenerate all forms of life, now and in the future. It's about making choices that protect the reproduction of life so it continues to thrive with us all. Well-being Well-being is all about living a good, decent and dignified life, where everyone's and everything's health and happiness matter more than how much stuff we own. It's about creating a world where we all feel safe, happy, fulfilled and connected to our communities. Sovereignty Sovereignty is the power of communities to make their own choices about their land, food, water, energy, currency, technology and resources. It's about being in control of what matters to us, ensuring our needs are met without harming the planet. This is particularly emphasised for colonised, oppressed, marginalised and occupied communities. Community Community is about building strong, supportive and resilient networks where we look after each other. It's celebrating togetherness and collaboration, creating a sense of belonging, mutual care and interdependence with each other and our surrounding ecosystems.</p>  <p> Principles of Degrowth  <br>   <br>Principles of degrowth are the actionable guidelines derived from its values. They offer a framework for making decisions and formulating strategies aimed at achieving the degrowth vision.  Resource sovereignty: Be a steward of nature Those making decisions about resource extraction should be the communities that are most directly impacted by these decisions, knowledgeable about ecosystems, and who assume the responsibility of stewards towards nature. Embracing the Pluriverse: Celebrate a world of many worlds We must recognise the beauty and necessity of diverse perspectives, cultures, and ecosystems coexisting. It's about understanding that there's not just one way to live, think, or be but a multitude of visions that enrich our global tapestry. Circularity: Waste not, want not The flow of energy and materials within the economy should remain as circular as possible with the goal of reducing the extraction of new resources and the amount of stuff we throw away for good. Socially useful production:  What is not needed should not be made Urging us to make only what society truly needs. Creating goods and services should satisfy needs and enhance well-being and sustainability; otherwise, they should be avoided.  Decolonising Futures: Unlearn, relearn, and heal Let us dismantle the colonial legacies that have shaped our economies, societies, and beliefs, oppressed billions, and limited our understanding of wealth, progress, and coexistence. Challenging the structures and narratives that have been imposed on us can help us embrace a multitude of diverse voices and histories. Small, not-for-profit cooperatives: People and planet, not profit All businesses should be small enough so everyone involved can have a say, be worker-owned, and aim to do good things for our communities and the Earth. Proximity & Cosmolocalism: Produce local, design global The shorter the distance between physical producers and consumers, the better. However, knowledge should be produced with the aim of sharing it globally so that others may benefit. Creative Visions: Art as a catalyst for change Embraces art's power to uniquely inspire, challenge, and imagine new ways of living and being. We'd all be creatives if only we had the time.   Convivial tools: Technology as a tool, not a master Let's use technology to help us, not control us. It should be made for specific needs we decide on, and we all should be able to understand and manage it easily. Think of tech that works for us so that everyone can say yes or no to it, and if needed, we can change our minds and go back. Healing Histories: Making amends for past wrongs This involves providing restitution and reparations to communities and individuals who have been harmed by actions such as colonisation, slavery, and environmental degradation. We aim to mend broken relationships and build a foundation for mutual respect and understanding. Postwork: Work less, play more The goal of our economy should be to make sure work takes up only a small part of our lives, leaving us free for fun, family, and hobbies. Work should be fair and enjoyable and leave plenty of time for what really matters to us. Active Change: Stand up, speak out  Those of us with privilege should use our voices and bodies to actively and physically resist growth and advocate for the demands of those with less privilege.   Value sovereignty: What matters most What's "valuable" changes based on what we care about and believe in from one place to another. It should not need a price tag to matter. Our choices about what's worth our time and resources should always reflect our deepest values and morals, understanding that different things matter to different people in profound ways. Health: Well-being for All Ensuring everyone enjoys good health and happiness is key. Accessible, holistic healthcare and lifestyles that nurture our physical, mental, and social well-being. Commons: Decide together Let's manage important resources together as a community, not as commodities to be bought and sold.  Reconnecting with Spirit: Rediscovering our bonds with the sacred Moving away from materialism and reconnecting with the deeper, often neglected aspects of existence: respecting the sacredness of all life forms and the planet. By fostering a spiritual connection, we nurture a sense of awe, gratitude, and stewardship for the Earth. Sharing: Sufficiency for all, overabundance for none Let's make sure there's enough for everyone but no excess that leads to inequality. If there's extra, we should use it carefully, always aiming to help those who need it most.  Feminist Futures: Centering equality We champion gender equity and the dismantling of patriarchal structures, advocating for a society where care and mutual respect guide our interactions. Relational goods: Less stuff, more relationships Let's value time with each other more than things. Our choices should bring us closer, focusing on what truly matters, like friendship and love, not just buying more stuff.  Transformative Learning: Empowering collective action Focus on sharing knowledge and ideas that inspire collective action and foster a culture of cooperation and empathy. It's about ensuring that learning extends beyond the classroom into every aspect of our lives, enabling us to communicate effectively and work together. Joie de vivre: If I can't dance, I don't want to be part of your economy Life's too short not to dance. Our economy should make us happy, letting us enjoy nature's and culture's riches and celebrate life in all its forms.</p>  <p>   <br>Want a deeper dive into degrowth principles and how they impact our approaches?</p>  <p>Check out This Article! <br>https://commonslibrary.org/degrowth-as-a-concept-and-practice-introduction/</p>  <p>   <br>This list was initially created by  Timothée Parrique  in his  doctorate thesis .
