summary: >-
  <p>Here, we explore actionable policies and strategies that challenge the conventional pursuit of economic growth, focusing instead on enhancing well-being for all within our planet's ecological limits. From guaranteeing universally basic services and redistributing wealth to prioritising local economies and increasing workplace democracy, these policies are about making bold choices for the health of our planet and the betterment of our communities.</p>

        <p>When discussing degrowth policies, the <b>key to meaningful and genuine conversations is understanding and respecting the context of those you're engaging with.</b> </p><p><b>Understanding Context:</b> It's important to focus conversations on topics that directly impact the individual's life. The context in which someone operates—be it their profession, community, or personal challenges—guides which degrowth policies are most pertinent and interesting to them.</p><p><b>Listening and Empathy</b>: Before diving into policy discussions, take the time to listen. Ask about the challenges they face, their hopes for the future, and what changes they wish to see in their community. Empathise with this and try to use this knowledge to find common ground.</p><p><b>Speaking to Everyday Concerns</b>: Most of your conversations should emphasise policies that speak to "bread and butter" issues—those that promise tangible improvements to day-to-day life and well-being. </p><p><b>Approaching with Humility</b>: Recognise that the transition to a degrowth society can seem daunting or scary to many. It represents a significant shift from the status quo, with unknowns that can be frightening. Approach these conversations with humility, gentleness, and respect. Acknowledge the fears and reservations of such a transition and highlight the supportive measures and benefits that degrowth policies offer to ease these concerns.</p>

        <p>There are hundreds of proposed policies, that could all work together to bring about a degrowth transition. To navigate this diversity, we have followed the excellent example set out by a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622023629" target="_blank">paper that mapped 530 policies<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a> and structured our content around 13 thematic areas (which you can navigate with the table of contents), each reflecting a critical aspect of degrowth. </p><p>Further, to allow for a more meaningful understanding of both the objectives of degrowth and the practical steps required to realise them, we distinguish <i>policy ends </i>and <i>policy means</i>:</p><p><b>Policy Ends (Goals, Objectives, Targets): </b>The 'what'—the outcomes we aim to achieve through degrowth. These goals guide our vision and outline the desired end states that reflect our values and priorities in the degrowth movement. These are labelled below as "O<i>bjective:</i>".</p><p><b>Policy Means (Methods, Instruments, Calibration): </b>The 'how'—the tools, methods, and processes we employ to achieve our degrowth objectives. This includes a range of policy instruments and interventions designed to address specific challenges and opportunities within each thematic area. These are listed below each objective.<br><br></p>

        <p><i><b>Reduce Environmental Pressures<br></b></i><i>Objective</i>: Implement strategies to significantly lower the ecological impact on our planet by reducing resource use, emissions, and pollution.</p><p><b>Diminishing Caps on Resource Use, Emissions, and Pollution:</b> Introduce policies that set progressively lower limits on the amount of natural resources consumed, greenhouse gases emitted, and pollutants released. These policies should prioritise resource-intensive industries such as petrochemicals, steel, iron, cement and automotive. This could require a global democratic cap and share programme or a mandated reduction of 40-50% of the biophysical footprint in overshooting nations. </p><p><b>Ecological Tax Reform:</b> Reform tax systems to incentivise sustainable practices and penalise environmental degradation. Taxes on carbon emissions, resource extraction, natural capital depletion, and pollution can discourage harmful activities. Divesting from unethical industries such as fossil fuels, mining, and arms simultaneously is also key.</p><p><b>Moratoria on Resource Extraction and Big Infrastructure: </b>Enact temporary halts on new resource extraction projects (like mining and deforestation) and large-scale infrastructure developments (such as dams and highways) that threaten ecosystems and biodiversity. <br><br></p><p><b><i>Halt Fossil Fuel Use<br></i></b><i>Objective</i>: Cease society's reliance on fossil fuels.</p><p><b>Abolish Fossil Fuel Subsidies</b>: Eliminate financial support and subsidies for fossil fuel industries equitably and justly.</p><p><b>Phase-Out of Existing Fossil Fuels</b>: Implement strategies for the gradual discontinuation of fossil fuel extraction and use (80-100% reduction by 2050), beginning with hyper-polluting power plants and ensuring a just transition for workers and communities dependent on these industries as well as universal basic electricity to households.</p><p><b>Nationalise to Phase-Out Fossil Companies</b>: Take fossil fuel companies into public ownership to manage the phase-out process, prioritising environmental protection and workers' rights over profits.<br><br><br><i><b>Promote Energy Democracy<br></b></i><i>Objective</i>: Ensure community control and equitable access to energy, fostering sustainable and renewable energy systems owned and managed by local communities.</p><p><b>Convivial Community-Owned Renewable Systems</b>: Support the development of renewable energy projects owned and operated by local communities, enhancing energy access and sovereignty.</p><p><b>Build Off-Grid Systems</b>: Encourage establishing off-grid renewable energy systems, particularly in remote or underserved areas, to provide sustainable and independent energy solutions.</p><p><b>Oppose Large-Scale Renewable Systems</b>: Advocate for energy solutions that are scalable and adaptable to local needs, avoiding the ecological and social issues associated with large-scale renewable energy projects.<br><i><b><br><br>Reduce Energy Demand and Use<br></b></i><i>Objective</i>: Implement strategies to significantly lower energy consumption and waste, promoting efficiency and sufficiency in energy use.</p><p><b>Energy Efficiency Improvements</b>: Implement policies that enhance energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industry, reducing overall energy demand.</p><p><b>Promote Energy Sufficiency</b>: Encourage practices and lifestyles that align with energy sufficiency, such as reducing unnecessary consumption, optimising energy use in homes and businesses, and supporting local, low-energy solutions.<br><b><br><br></b><b><i>Restore and Preserve Biodiversity<br></i></b><i>Objective</i>: Implement measures to protect, restore, and enhance the diversity of life on Earth, from genes and species to ecosystems.</p><p><b>Legislate the Rights of Nature</b>: Recognise ecosystems and natural entities as legal subjects with rights, enabling legal actions to protect biodiversity. Strengthen regulations to stop the commercialisation of nature and establish a coherent network of marine protected areas.</p><p><b>Create Resource Sanctuaries</b>: Designate protected areas as sanctuaries for biodiversity, prohibiting activities that could harm wildlife or degrade natural habitats. Advocate for the preservation of knowledge, languages and techniques that protect life.<br><br><br><b><i>Promote Stable Demography<br></i></b><i>Objective</i>: Encourage democratic demographic stability by achieving sustainable population levels.</p><p><b>Bottom-up Empowerment of Women</b>: Support policies and programmes that empower women to make informed decisions about reproduction, including access to contraception and reproductive health services.</p><p><b>Educational and Vocational Opportunities for Women and Girls</b>: Increase access to education and vocational training for women and girls, recognising the strong link between education and reduced fertility rates.</p>

        <p><b><i>Promote Financial Democracy<br></i></b><i>Objective</i>: Enhance democratic control over financial systems to ensure they serve the public good, prioritise sustainability, and support economic equity.</p><p><b>Democratise and Decentralise Money Creation</b>: Advocate for public authorities, rather than private banks, to have the primary power to create money, ensuring that monetary policy serves community needs and environmental sustainability. This includes breaking up large financial institutions, enforcing full reserve banking and banning interest on loans. </p><p><b>Support Community-Owned Financial Institutions</b>: Encourage the development and use of locally-owned and operated credit unions, cooperative banks, and mutual credit systems, which are more accountable to local communities and can direct investment towards local and sustainable projects.</p><p><b>Implement Progressive Taxation</b>: Reform tax systems to include progressive taxation on wealth and capital, financial transaction taxes, global standards for international tax and investment policies, and elimination of tax havens, ensuring a fair distribution of resources and contribution to society.<br><br><br><i><b>Foster Ethical and Non-Speculative Finance<br></b></i><i>Objective</i>: Shift financial practices towards ethical, transparent, and sustainable investments, reducing short-term speculation and prioritising long-term ecological and social well-being.</p><p><b>Support Non-Speculative Currencies and Exchange Systems</b>: Promote the use of local or regional currencies, time banks, collective finance, and other non-debt-based exchange systems that encourage community resilience and sustainability over profit.</p><p><b>Encourage Socially Responsible Investing</b>: Advocate for investment policies and practices that are non-speculative, long-term and prioritise social and environmental criteria, such as a Green New Deal without growth, ecological restoration projects, care services, small-scale renewable energy projects and universal basic services.</p>

        <p><i><b>Limit Tourism<br></b></i><i>Objective</i>: Implement strategies to reduce the environmental and social impacts of tourism.</p><p><b>Limit Fossil-Fuel-Based Travel</b>: Introduce measures to decrease high-carbon and distant travel, promoting more sustainable forms of transportation and travel activities. This could include implementing or increasing tourist taxation, reducing shipping activities, restricting cruise ships, progressive taxation on ship size, taxing the full environmental cost of travel, reducing passenger travel levels (especially in sensitive areas), etc.</p><p><b>Moratorium on Tourism Developments</b>: Establish temporary halts on new tourism development projects in environmentally sensitive areas, allowing for assessment and planning to ensure sustainability and social needs are being met.</p><p><b>Local Cooperative Ownership</b>: Support tourism enterprises owned and operated by local communities, ensuring benefits are shared and tourism practices align with community values and ecological limits.<br><br><br><i><b>Rethink Tourism<br></b></i><i>Objective</i>: Transform our perception of tourism to prioritise ecological preservation, cultural integrity, and social equity, fostering a more responsible and sustainable industry.</p><p><b>Promote Slow and Sustainable Tourism</b>: Encourage travel that emphasises connection with local cultures, environmental respect, and meaningful experiences over convenience and quantity. Similarly, we should promote campaigns that help reassess our need for speed, elitism, and social privilege. </p><p><b>Prioritise the right to live over the right to travel</b>: Oppose UNWTO's proposal to turn tourism into a human right, redefining tourism as "voluntary hosting of visitors in local communities for the benefit of locals". Favour equity, justice, residents, refugees, and the environment over holidays, wealth and ability to pay. </p>

        <p><i><b>Limit Long-Distance Trade<br></b></i><i>Objective</i>: Reduce the environmental impact and social inequalities resulting from extensive global trade networks, promoting more localised and sustainable economic models.</p><p><b>Export Quotas &amp; Reducing Demand: </b>Introduce export quotas to limit the volume of goods that can be shipped long distances, prioritising local and regional consumption and production cycles. Simultaneously, transport demands should be reduced where possible (especially aviation).</p><p><b>Transition Road Freight to Electric or Rail</b>: Encourage the shift from road to rail for freight transport and incentivise smaller scale last mile delivery such as cargo bikes. Ports should also become cooperatives that can limit ship traffic.</p><p><b>Shorter Supply Chains</b>: Support policies and business practices that shorten supply chains, enhancing local production and reducing the environmental impact associated with transporting goods across long distances.<br><br><br><i><b>Rethink Trade<br></b></i><i>Objective</i>: Transform trade agreements and practices to prioritise environmental sustainability, social equity, and the well-being of all communities, particularly those in Global South societies.</p><p><b>Renegotiate Trade Agreements</b>: Advocate for the revision of existing trade agreements to include strict environmental standards, labour rights, and equitable terms for all involved nations, particularly prioritising the needs and rights of the Global South. Particular attention must be put to agricultural subsidies in the Global North.</p><p><b>Ease Intellectual Property Rights</b>: Push for reforms in international intellectual property regulations to allow greater sharing of knowledge, technology, and essential medicines, supporting global health and collective progress. This includes the commonification of patents.</p>
