summary: >
  Graphic novels are a fantastic way to make the debate about degrowth and economics accessible to climate activists, teachers, students, workers, parents, and anyone else who isn’t a classical economist but wants to help stop climate collapse. This page displays several comic books you can share with friends and family or read yourself!<br><br>‘Who Is Afraid of Degrowth’ is particularly focused on degrowth. It contains quotes from a wide range of experts woven into an engaging narrative that invites you to explore and join this crucial debate about economics, ecology, democracy, human rights, technology, and our future.

        <p>Degrowth is not only possible and necessary; it entails all kinds of good stuff you probably haven’t heard about. It is also, despite all claims to the contrary, something that cannot be done to people but can only be truly achieved by a mass movement of the people.</p><p>‘Who Is Afraid of Degrowth’ offers a new way to learn about degrowth and join the most important debate of our time.</p>

        <p>"World Without End" is the fruit of a years-long collaboration between Christophe Blain and Jean-Marc Jancovici where they explore our dependence on fossil fuels, the profound changes our planet is undergoing, and the resulting consequences for society as a whole. The dream of endless economic growth might be an illusion... but that doesn't mean we are doomed to destruction, if we take the necessary steps today. A candid and empathetic analysis that leaves readers with a better understanding of today's world and where we go from here as a society. (Available in English and French)<br></p>

        <p>"A murderous Bambi or a Nazi teddy bear are some of the characters that inhabit the strange vignettes of Miguel Brieva, one of the protagonists of the new generation of Spanish comics. His absurd and cruel world is a reflection of our current consumerist, standardised and uncritical society. An extremely original, lucid and radical graphic work, presented in alphabetical order in the manner of an encyclopaedia."</p>
