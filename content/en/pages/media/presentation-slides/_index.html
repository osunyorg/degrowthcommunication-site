        <p>This presentation is about post-development worldviews that push us to think beyond degrowth. It is filled with real-life examples of radical alternatives as well as a framework of transformation emerging from grounded alternatives. This presentation is perfect for people who are already aware of degrowth and want to expand their knowledge beyond it.
