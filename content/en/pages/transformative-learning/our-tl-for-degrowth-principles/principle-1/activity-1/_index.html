    <p><b>Critical Reflective Visioning Spaces</b></p><p>Aim: Create a learning space where participants critically reflect on the need for economic growth and co-create alternative visions.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>Description  <br>   <br>Organize critical reading circles using selected materials (readings, videos, podcasts, non-formal learning interactive activities) on growth and dominant socio-economic structures and their critiques. Participants think about alternatives and collectively envision a degrowth society. They are encouraged to imagine alternative systems for meeting human needs (e.g., food, energy, housing, and transportation) while prioritizing relationality, ecological health, and justice.</p>  <p> Materials needed  <br>   <br>Selected materials (readings, videos, podcasts, non-formal learning interactive activities) on critiques of economic growth and alternatives. Try to choose and combine different materials based on your group characteristics and resource constraints (e.g., time). Paper, pens, flipchart or whiteboard, markers.</p>  <p> Activity 1.1. - “Tracing the Roots, Imagining the Canopy”  <br>   <br>Level of complexity: Low - Medium Estimated time: 2 hours  <br> Provide the central theme of  climate justice  and have participants create  visual maps  of how various ideas, practices, and systems (economic, political, cultural, ecological) intersect and influence one another.  <br> If participants are already aware of degrowth but they do not know each other, invite them to share  personal stories or perspectives  on degrowth. Prompt questions: What does degrowth mean to you? What is the relationship between sustainability and justice?  <br> Invite participants to engage in a personal or collective  visual visioning exercise  about their preferable degrowth futures. </p>  <p> Activity 1.2. - “Beyond the Surface: Unearthing Value”  <br>   <br>Level of complexity: Low - Medium Estimated time: 3 hours  <br> Ask participants to listen in advance to the podcast “Is GDP fit for purpose?” with Bob Costanza, Kate Pickett, and Sandrine Dixson-Declève. Podcast: Is GDP fit for purpose?    <br> Use the “Growth Quarters Activity” to  learn more about GDP  and discuss its pros and cons. Growth Quartets | Endlich Wachstum    <br> Collectively create Gibson-Graham’s iceberg model of diverse economies based on our everyday socio-economic experiences, relationships, and interactions. This exercise helps us understand that many aspects of our lives cannot be measured and that a good life and well-being extend beyond economic growth. Diverse Economies Iceberg  <br>  <br> Briefly introduce the concept of degrowth and invite participants to engage in a personal or collective  visual visioning exercise  about their preferable futures. </p>  <p> Activity 1.3. - “Cutting Through the Noise: Rethinking Growth”  <br>   <br>Level of complexity: Low - Medium Estimated time: 3 hours  <br> Use the “Opinion Barometer” as a starting activity and select some of the statements to understand the  different arguments  the participants may have for and against growth. Opinion barometer | Endlich Wachstum    <br> Use “The Two Sides of a Coin” to go deeper into the  pros  and  cons  of economic growth. The Two Sides of a Coin | Endlich Wachstum    <br> They collectively reflect on possible  alternatives . Prompt question: What alternative ideas, models, and narratives could we use to move beyond growth? How can these ideas be applied in practice and in our everyday lives?  <br> Briefly introduce the concept of degrowth and invite participants to engage in a personal or collective  visual visioning exercise  about their preferable futures.  <br> Alternatively, for a more  simplified version , use the toolkit “Let’s talk about degrowth” and implement the first part of it, inviting participants to respond to the following questions:  <br> What are the underlying  assumptions , narratives, and myths that make economic growth necessary and desirable?  <br> Can you think of  examples  where economic growth has led to negative consequences for society and the planet?  <br> They collectively reflect on possible  alternatives . Prompt question: What alternative ideas, models, and narratives could we use to move beyond growth? How can these ideas be applied in practice and in our everyday lives?  <br> Briefly introduce the concept of degrowth and invite participants to engage in a personal or collective  visual visioning exercise  about their preferable futures. </p>  <p> “Let’s talk about degrowth" toolkit  <br>Degrowth Toolkit by Amerissa Giannouli</p>  <p> Navigation  <br>  </p>  <p>Back to Principle#1 <br>https://explore.degrowth.net/transformative-learning/our-tl-for-degrowth-principles/principle-1/</p>  <p>Back to all TL Principles <br>https://explore.degrowth.net/transformative-learning/our-tl-for-degrowth-principles/</p>  <p>Back to TL Home <br>https://explore.degrowth.net/transformative-learning/</p>
