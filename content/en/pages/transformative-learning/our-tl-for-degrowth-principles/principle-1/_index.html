  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Transformative Learning for Degrowth encourages us to engage in deeper exploration of alternative perspectives that redefine our understanding of economic and ecological relationships. However, instead of merely critiquing existing frameworks, we focus on reflecting, reading, writing, speaking, and acting with care and intention. We engage in creative and visionary thinking that seeks patterns of difference, recognizing how various ideas and practices intersect and influence one another. Different perspectives and experiences can intersect to create new insights and understandings. This approach encourages us to embrace diverse viewpoints and plurality, allowing for a more profound understanding of sustainability and justice that arise from our interconnectedness and sense of responsibility.</p>  <p> Pruning Shear  <br>   <br>Transformative Learning is the gardener’s pruning shears—used carefully, it cuts away overgrowth and dead branches, allowing the plant of knowledge to breathe, flourish, and grow in its intended shape.</p>  <p> Activities  <br>  </p>  <p>Browse proposed Activities for this Principle <br>https://explore.degrowth.net/transformative-learning/our-tl-for-degrowth-principles/principle-1/activity-1/</p>  <p> Degrowth Toolkit Let't talk about Degrowth</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Back to all TL for Degrowth Principles <br>https://explore.degrowth.net/transformative-learning/our-tl-for-degrowth-principles/</p>  <p>Back to TL Home <br>https://explore.degrowth.net/transformative-learning/</p>
