  body: >-
    <p>Why Degrowth requires Transformative Learning?  <br>   <br>The economic system around us is woven around the dominant views of ‘more is better,’ ‘larger is stronger,’ ‘private is controllable and hence convenient,’ etc. These worldviews, which are composed of both open and hidden narratives, directly or indirectly govern all our actions, thoughts, and decisions. These thought processes are built within us systematically. Usually, we pick these up from our cultural and educational systems, where non-formal and formal learning begins, and then these mental models get reinforced by our families, societies, employers, service providers—pretty much everyone. When these worldviews are embedded in all systems and constantly bombarded from all directions, it is difficult to believe that an alternative, such as sustainable degrowth, is possible. But can we challenge this? Can we re-evaluate the concepts of a good life? Can we rethink who we are vis-à-vis other human and non-human beings? And can we challenge our belief that material growth always leads to safety, security, well-being, and happiness? We need to ask these questions and more like these.</p>  <p> How could Transformative Learning help?  <br>   <br>This is where transformative learning methodologies become paramount to begin working on such questions. To challenge the dominant focus on endless economic growth, which has deeply shaped our ways of being and relating to one another, as well as to the human and more-than-human world.  <br> To enable us to develop a new understanding of what it means to be successful.  <br> To help us appreciate the non-market activities and the alternative ways of working together.  <br> To invite us to rethink our values, reflect on our attitudes, and reshape our behaviors in pursuit of justice and well-being, fostering a balanced and responsible relationship with nature.  <br> Above all, to create a participative ecosystem where we can all connect, share our strengths, and work together to define, ideate, and solve the most pressing challenges of our times. </p>  <p> What might Transformative Learning for Degrowth look like?  <br>   <br> Educational programs and workshops focused on sustainability, critical thinking, and ecological justice.  <br> Participatory practices that include diverse stakeholders, particularly those marginalized by the current system.  <br> Storytelling, arts, and experiential learning to make the degrowth message emotionally resonant and personally meaningful. </p>  <p> These are our Principles in Transformative Learning for Degrowth  <br>  </p>  <p>Back to TL Home <br>https://explore.degrowth.net/transformative-learning/</p>
